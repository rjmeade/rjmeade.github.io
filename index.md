My name is Rick Meade, and I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from the University of California, Irvine. Next year, I will be attending Cornell University for my Master's in Mechanical Engineering. Linked below are some of the academic experiences I have had at UCI that have shaped who I am as a person and as an engineer!
