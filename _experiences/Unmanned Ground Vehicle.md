description of project and main requirements. complete mechanical redesign of ground vehicle. resume points

### **Pugh Analysis**
all the points in the above doc, used as a baseline for which design to consider not necessarily using this as the one determining factor, if results are bad will go to next design

### **Chassis Design**

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCidBGVP144CgS7ryeVXHvK3MslbDL7anKJ8DWIuYfE/edit?usp=sharing
started w/ chassis. had to make it big enough to fit electronics, strong enough, light enough. started w/ box, did some geometry so motors can fit and to reduce weight. talk about interfacing with other subteams' requirements

##### **Weight Reduction Cutouts**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mj0WMciACzzMQM8xgFJug9A__k3-08BqU7eei_G_F94/edit?usp=sharing
static load simulations, tried a lot and tracked results on spreadsheet to ultimately determine best configuration and to document for internal design review.

##### **Material Selection**
manufacturability, access to tools, cost

### **Motor Selection**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rzQFTP_KRp-2N3eoEtwZQk6rN4l2ZuUx1Auv5IDLwPs/edit?usp=sharing
took desired acceleration and used maximum distance we would have to travel to determine how much torque our motor would have to output. did research and looked for motor that fit the specs.
