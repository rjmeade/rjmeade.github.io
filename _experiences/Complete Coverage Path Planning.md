One of my primary responsibilities on UAV Forge last year was to design and implement our drone's path planning algorithm. We were tasked with searching a region for targets in the most time-efficient manner possible due to strict flight time restrictions, an archetype of problem called complete coverage path planning.

Complete coverage path planning is the process of generating a path for our drone to follow that allows it to visit every point in a specified area. Since the competition does not provide the exact geographic location of each target, the drone must cover every point in the search area. Below is a figure showing an example of a complete coverage path.

### **Boustrophedon Decomposition**

Our approach utilizes a method called boustrophedon cell decomposition, which first divides the search area into individual subregions. The path planning algorithm then sweeps each subregion individually. Boustrophedon decomposition is deterministic and
