On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I volunteer at a local middle school to help with their robotics program. My middle and high school robotics teams had a huge impact on my life, and I wanted to pay it forward so that other students can have the same experience I had.

It is truly inspiring to see the next generation of engineers develop a passion for engineering and robotics. The technical and soft skills students learn are invaluable, and students are able to gain hands-on experience building and iterating on their designs.
