Tuesdays and Thursdays volunteer at a local middle school to help with their robotics team. vex robotics had a large impact on my life, so i wanted to pay it forward and mentor other teams.

impact a lot of students, teach them about engineering concepts both technical and soft skills. most importantly how to be a good person (teammate, leader, problem solver).

empower the engineers of tomorrow.
